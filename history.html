        <h2>1994</h2>
        <p>Sprouting from the 9C1 police package Caprice, GM designer Jon Moss stirred up the auto world when he brought
            back a Chevy Impala SS concept at the 1992 L.A. Auto Show. The '94 model debuted with a 260-horsepower
            5.7-liter V8 LT1 engine, but the public let out a collective moan when it found out it was only coupled with
            a four-speed automatic trans with the gear shifter on the steering column. The new car, which cost $22,495
            was produced only in black on 17-inch five-spoke aluminum wheels with retro Impala badges. It had a lowered
            sports suspension with De Carbon gas-pressurized shocks, dual exhaust, a high-capacity reverse flow cooling

        <h2>1995</h2>
        <p> The '95 SS continued with two new colorways, Dark Cherry and Green-Gray, two options that don't stretch too
            far from the jet black signature. Chevy took the new SS's "dog leg" rear roof pillar and added it to the
            Caprice, making it slightly less original, but its high-quality suspension and additional aesthetic features
            kept it a class above. <br></p>
        <h2>1996</h2>
        <p>Priced at $24,405, the SS lived out its final year in glory before it got chopped once again, this time with
            the Caprice as well. Despite its imminent demise, Chevy fixed pretty much every bug from the previous
            models, uplifting an already great vehicle. The instrument panel was completely redone to include a
            tachometer and they moved the shifter to the floor, making it a more distinct sports car and separating it
            further from the Caprice. <br></p>
